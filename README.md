This is a web application based on React, Redux (for managing states, instead of keyword arguments in URL) and external API provied by newsdata.io to view the latest news from all around the globe, also based on filters and queries. It can show the same result when scrolling down since 
newsdata.io sometimes sends results with nextPage=None, which results in me sending them request with the keyword argument page=None. I have reported that, and they are working on it.

Giroud er markahæsti leikmaður karlalandsliðsins frá upphafi með 53 mörk í 122 landsleikjum.

Sigurvegarar Intel Grand Slam fá 1 milljón dollara í verðlaunafé, eða tæpar 140 milljónir króna. FaZe er eitt fjögurra liða í heiminum sem hafa náð þessum sérstaka titli, en Astralis, Liquid og Natus Vincere hafa náð því áður. Hvernig vinnur lið titilinn? Til þess að vera Intel Grand Slam sigurvegari þarf lið að vinna fjóra stóra titla af 10 keppnum haldnar í samstarfi við tæknirisann Intel. Enn af þessum titlum þarf að vera stórmót í Counter-Strike. FaZe var valið lið ársins 2022 þar sem liðið vann 3 af 4 stórum mótum ársins og því vel við hæfi að ná þessum sérstaka titli.

      content:
        "Delegati šahovskih klubov so na rednem volilnem občnem zboru edinega kandidata soglasno potrdili za novega predsednika ŠZS. Generalni direktor Slovenskih železnic je doslej zasedal mesto podpredsednika UO ŠZS in je že dodobra seznanjen z izzivi slovenskega šaha. O tem priča tudi njegov izjemno ambiciozen program, ki ga je predstavil v nagovoru članstvu ŠZS. Še posebej se lahko veseli slovenski vrhunski šah, ki mu bo odslej namenjena posebna pozornost in pa mladi nadarjeni šahisti, ki si lahko obetajo sofinanciranje v obliki štipendij. Zmagovita investicijska kombinacija kar kliče po novih dosežkih in bodočih šahovskih velemojstrih. Zmagovita investicijska kombinacija kar kliče po novih dosežkih in bodočih šahovskih velemojstrih. Občni zbor je priložnost za pregled preteklega mandatnega obdobja, ki je bilo v veliki večini zaznamovano z epidemijo in predčasnim odhodom dotedanjega predsednika zaradi njegove kandidature za predsednika države. Ocenjeno je bilo za enega uspešnejših doslej, saj smo po večletnem organizacijskem premoru na slovenskih tleh pod okriljem ŠZS znova gostili dve najpomembnejši šahovski prvenstvi stare celine: ekipno EP za članice in člane 2021 ter posamično EP za člane 2022. S tem se je Slovenija ponovno globoko zasidrala na evropskem organizacijskem šahovskem zemljevidu in postala aktivna članica ECU in FIDE. Na letnem srečanju šahistov so bila podeljena številna priznanja, pohvale in plakete ŠZS za dolgoletno delo v šahu in posamezne dosežke. Dobitnika bronaste plakete ŠZS sta postala (ŠD Kočevje) in (ŠD Krka Novo mesto), ki že več desetletij pomembno soustvarjata uspešne šahovske zgodbe na regijskem nivoju. Srebrno plaketo ŠZS sta za dolgoletno delo v šahu in organizacijske zasluge prejela (ŠK Loška dolina) in (ŠD Milan Vidmar), nadalje za vrhunske tekmovalne dosežke in izpolnitev pogojev za naslov velemojstra ter ŠD Fram ob 90. obletnici delovanja. ŠZS je prestižni naziv »ambasadorka šaha« tokrat podelila odlični šahistki in psihologinji . Medtem, ko smo na domačem parketu dobili novo šahovsko vodstvo, se na EP za članice v Črni gori bijejo še zadnji boji šahovskih »amazonk«. Kar sedem naših mladenk išče svoje priložnosti v močni konkurenci 136 igralk iz 34 držav. Na vrhu razpredelnice tri kola pred koncem s 6,5 točkami kraljujejo Poljakinje in Gruzijke ( ), močno pa jim za ovratnik dihajo Francozinje. Naša najvišje uvrščena na lestvici je , ki s 5. točkami deli 20. mesto in ima le še skromne možnosti za preboj med prvo deveterico, ki prinaša uvrstitev na svetovni pokal. Vse kaže tudi, da se bo tokrat zelo želena velemojstrska norma izmuznila naši , ki ji v črnogorskem Petrovacu žal ne gre po načrtih. Daleč od načrtov pa je se je pričel odvijati tudi prestižni ženski Grand Prix v Indiji, kjer je tamkajšnja prestolnica New Delhi postala prizorišče škandala, ki pretresa šahovski svet. Od predvidenih 12 udeleženk sta udeležbo iz neznanih razlogov že v osnovi odpovedali sloviti sestri . Zaradi pripomb nad organizacijo je tik pred pričetkom, tekmovanje zapustila še kazahstanska zvezdnica , čemur je sledil še šokantni odstop kolegice , ki je skupaj z ostalimi udeleženkami v pismu predsednika FIDE pozvala, naj se turnir prekine in prestavi na ustreznejši čas z namenom, da se tekmovanja lahko udeležijo vse predvidene igralke. Serija štirih turnirjev Grand Prix je vedno slovela po vrhunski organizaciji, ki je najboljšim šahistkam tudi s tem izkazovala posebno pozornost in spoštovanje. Kako se bodo razhajanja med FIDE in igralkami odvila, bomo priče v nadaljevanju, vsekakor pa tovrstni dogodki neugodno vplivajo na kvaliteto samega tekmovanja in ugled turnirja. A vendarle na drugi strani pripomorejo k spremembam, navadno na bolje.",

The 28-year-old midfielder has interest from Pep Guardiola at , while last week has put the club on alert for interest in several first-team players at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea boss Graham Potter has given Kovacic the captain’s armband due to injuries to Cesar Azpilicueta and Thiago Silva and the January sale of Jorginho to Arsenal. There is a growing feeling, however, that he could be sold as part of a summer clear-out, with the Blues targeting another defensive midfielder to partner British transfer-record signing Enzo Fernandez and needing to raise funds to comply with financial regulations. The club reported a loss of £121million for last season, attributed in part to government sanctions placed on former owner Roman Abramovich, following on from a £153m loss in 2020/21. Future in doubt: Chelsea could cash in on midfielder Mateo Kovacic this summer West Ham’s Declan Rice, Brighton duo Moises Caicedo and Alexis Mac Allister and Southampton’s Romeo Lavia could all be targets having been of interest to the Blues in the past few windows, but Chelsea must also raise significant funds from player sales if they are to avoid falling foul of the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules, which prohibit loss-making of more than £105m over a rolling three-year period. N’Golo Kante, meanwhile, is in the final stages of agreeing a new two-year contract with an option for a further 12 months on the table. His renewal will be a victory for the Boehly-Clearlake ownership group who are expected to fend off interest from Barcelona, with just three months left on Kante’s current deal. Chelsea believe the 31-year-old is ready to play a major role over the rest of the season after to play in a behind-closed-doors friendly against Charlton at Cobham at the weekend.",

        "The list features sportswomen, leaders, change-makers, amplifiers and grassroots contributors.",
      content:
        "ngland captain has topped the BBC Woman’s Hour Power List 2023. The list recognises 30 women in the UK who have made a “significant impact in the sporting world” and was revealed live on the programme by host Nuala McGovern in front of an audience in the BBC Radio Theatre on Tuesday morning. Williamson, 25, led the to glory at last summer’s Uefa Women’s Euros, as they became the first England football team to win an international tournament since 1966. As an Arsenal defender, she has won a number of major trophies during her career, including the Women’s Super League, the FA Cup and the League Cup twice. She also champions equal opportunities for girls in sport, the BBC said. SPONSORED Williamson said: “It’s lovely, I’m just trying to do my job. My mum will be happy. It’s really nice, I’m slightly taken aback by that but very appreciative.” Asked why the Woman’s Hour Power List is important, she said: “As women we’ve been living in the shadows, maybe, but we know that we have the ability to step up. “If you can’t see it, you can’t be it, which is why when we do recognise women like this, it’s great because those aspiring to be in these positions can believe that there is a place for them in the sporting world.” Suggestions for the shortlist, which features sportswomen, leaders, change-makers, amplifiers and grassroots contributors, were chosen by the public for the judges to consider. The judging panel included Olympic hockey player , Paralympian Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, World Cup-winning cricketer Ebony Rainford-Brent and former footballer Jessica Creighton acting as chair. Second on the list is Baroness , director of women’s football at the , where she has championed equality, diversity and access in women’s football, the BBC said. The 74-year-old was made a dame in the 2020 New Year Honours list for her services to sport, recognising more than five decades she has spent influencing policy, as well as co-founding and chairing the Youth Sport Trust. Alice Dearing, who became the first black woman to swim for Great Britain at the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020, is third on the BBC Woman’s Hour Power List. She is one of the four co-founders of the Black Swimming Association, a non-profit organisation aimed at championing diversity in swimming from grassroots to the elite level. The 25-year-old’s advocacy for diversity includes FINA’s decision in 2022 to add oversized swimming caps to its approved competitive swimwear list, to accommodate swimmers with thicker or longer hair, following an initial ban. The Woman’s Hour Power List was first launched in 2013 and has celebrated the achievements of British women in different spheres of public life. Karen Dalziel, editor of BBC Woman’s Hour, said: “The Women in Sport Power List recognises 30 incredible women whose passion, dedication and expertise is transforming the profile and experience of women’s sport. “We are proud to celebrate the unique qualities and achievements of each of these amazing women as they inspire others and bring about lasting change.” Other names on the 2023 power list include: 4. Ellie Downie, medal-winning gymnast for Great Britain who has spoken out about abusive behaviour in British Gymnastics 5. Heather Dunnell, founder of the Scottish Women’s Walking Group 6. Helen Hardy, who created the only official retail platform in the world dedicated to women’s football merchandise 7. Lotte Wubben-Moy, Arsenal and England footballer who campaigned for equal access to football for girls in the UK 8. Beth Barrett-Wild, director of the women’s professional game at the England and Wales Cricket Board 9. Sophie Christiansen CBE, eight times Paralympic equestrian gold medallist 10. Dina Asher-Smith, British record holder for 100m sprint",

        "n our technologically advanced world, don’t tell me your watch only tells the time? That is pre-2015. Why this date? Well that’s when the Apple Watch was released and the ability to do far more than keep up with the hour and minute of any present day entered the mainstream. Of course, the likes of Garmin existed far early than this and Seiko had been manufacturing computer function-packed wrist pieces as early as 1980s but as is the case with all things Apple, this is when its innvovation caused a boom in the market. Now wearables are one of the most popular and greatest revenue categories on the market with smartwatches leading the way. Beyond just an Apple Watch, there are smartwatches across the spectrum of affordability and with a varying quantity of functions. Fitbits and their step-counting devices were once the dominant label, joined by Samsung, Garmin, Xiaomi and more so you can find an option that pairs with your phone, computer or headphones with ease. Ever-growing in their information gathering, monitoring and sharing, you can keep up to date on your steps, blood pressure, heart rate, sleep quality, texts, calls, and even blood oxygen levels. You can even use to make payments and track fitness - all while having a fashion-forward timepiece. And if you shop during Amazon Prime Day, you’ll be able to get all of that at a fraction of their RRP. Strap in because if you’re unfamiliar with Amazon’s Prime Day sale, you may just have your mind blown. It’s the online retailing giant’s discount extravaganza that took place twice in 2022. There was one in July as a mid-summer treat and another in October, a pre-sale to Black Friday. The retailer says it is when they will be offering its best ever discounts. The Amazon Spring Sale is set to follow suit. The Spring Sale will be live from 18:00 on Monday, March 27 until 23:59 on Wednesday, March 29. Prime Day is an event exclusively for Amazon Prime Day customers. This means you will need to subscribe to being a Prime customer. This will give access to the sale, unlimited next day delivery, Prime Video, free Kindle books and far more, making the outlay of £8.99 a month or £95 a year stretch further. This is not the case for the Spring Sale where anyone and everyone can get involved. Amazon has revealed that there will be up to 35 per cent on wearable from the likes of Google, Samsung and more. Was: £379 Was: £449 Apple’s latest smartwatch - the Apple Watch Series 8 - is unsurprisingly the most advanced to date. The ultimate health companion, it takes monitoring to the next level to include Crash Detection that automatically connects you to emergency services, providing your location and notifying your contacts as well as improving the sensors to monitor your blood oxygen levels, heart rate and ECG sensors. It also records your daily activity for an in-depth analysis of your workouts, all while acting as a satellite phone so you can get calls and texts, ask for help and use Apple Pay.

The Versa 3 comes in a different range of colours from its predecessor and features a larger number of features, like a Daily Readiness Score to help you plan your workouts and built in GPS.

Dan Lydiate put in a frankly ridiculous defensive performance, scything down Springboks time after time in arguably his best individual performance since chopping down French bodies on the way to a Grand Slam in 2012. And then, in the closing embers, Gareth Anscombe showed equal measures of skill and nerve to set up Josh Adams' try before slotting the crucial conversion from the touchline to secure a famous victory. Since that piece of history in Bloemfontein, Lydiate and Anscombe have unfortunately sustained injuries that have kept them out for parts of the current campaign. But, you would imagine both will be in the mix when Warren Gatland comes to name his World Cup training squad later this year.

The same can almost certainly be said of Rhys Webb, so long in the wilderness but now back perhaps as Wales' starting scrum-half. Yet while all three Ospreys stars are probably quietly confident they will feature in France later this year, their contract situations for next season certainly would inspire less faith. In fact, we are at a point where all three have felt moved to speak out about matters on social media, something of a rarity when it comes to the era of media-trained players. Starting with Anscombe, the fly-half has long been linked with a move away from Welsh rugby, with France and Japan often touted as potential destinations. Ahead of his return to action following an injury, there had been reports in The Rugby Paper at the weekend of a deal being offered that would equate to a £100,000 pay cut. The playmaker has since come out on Twitter to pour cold water on the reports. Whether simply no deal has been offered or it is one with different terms is unclear, although it's understood talks had gone quiet after Anscombe picked up his shoulder injury against Australia in the autumn. Despite being a player Gatland has spoken of highly in the past, and a fly-half trusted as a starter in 2019 and may well do again this year, it's hard to see Anscombe sticking around in Welsh rugby beyond the end of the season. That doesn't hurt his Welsh chances, given he is not captured by the newly-reduced 25-cap rule, but equally it's not ideal in the build-up to a tournament for a player's future to be taking so long to sort. The same goes for Webb. The scrum-half isn't exactly thrilled with the offer he has had from the Ospreys, a one-year extension which would see him earn half of what he's on right now. There are offers from Japan that he is considering, although it's understood he would rather stay in Wales. Whether he does remains to be seen, but it's clear how much frustration the situation is causing. Hours after putting in a man-of-the-match performance against Italy during the Six Nations, Webb posted \"#anyjobs\" on social media. Which brings us to perhaps the most unfortunate of the trio. Unlike Anscombe and Webb, it's fairly concrete in the sense that there is no deal currently on the table for Lydiate. The 34-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season. Obviously, injuries haven't been that kind to the back-rower in recent years. But this is a player who overcame a broken neck while still a teenager. He is insistent that he is in better shape than ever before as he goes \"hell for leather\" to try and land a new deal. A try-scoring performance against the Dragons at the weekend showed that, he was excellent in South Africa last summer, yet as things stand he has only three more games to make an impression. The idea of Lydiate not getting a contract for next season, even with his age and injury concerns, is a tough one to get your head around. He can still do a job on the international stage, after all. So, even for as consummate a professional as Lydiate, the decision to use social media to vent his concerns about the current situation isn't exactly surprising. After the victory over the Dragons, Lydiate tweeted, albeit with his tongue firmly in cheek, that \"if anyone is looking for a young up-and-coming six for next season with plenty life in him\", they should give him a call. Another tweet reiterated that the \"old bull\" still had rugby left in him, with the hashtag \"#stillchasingacontract\" included at the end. Hopefully he will get that contract sorted. After all, the Llaithddu herd of Welsh Black cattle will keep for a little while longer without his full-on supervision at the family farm should he nail down his playing future for next year. Whatever, the sight of players venting their frustrations over contracts is a deeply concerning one and it is a situation which is unlikely to get better in the short-term. Around the regions, other players who could feature at the World Cup are still uncertain over their futures. Leigh Halfpenny and Rhys Patchell have been linked with moves away from the Scarlets, while plenty of words have been committed to print about the futures of Josh Adams and Liam Williams as Cardiff try to sort out a squad for next season. WalesOnline understands that other Welsh internationals currently in contract beyond the end of this season have been warned over their own situation and how they might be moved on to free up funds. Granted, those involved are perhaps a little removed from the current Wales set-up compared to the likes of Adams and Williams, but it's not outside the realms of possibility they could feature in the World Cup, too. At the very least, they are the definition of regional servants. Some, in fact, are one-club men and likely would wish to remain so. Welsh rugby took a big step forward at the weekend as member clubs voted overwhelmingly in favour of reform to the Welsh Rugby Union's governance structure, but there is still a lot of pain to withstand before things get better. Just a cursory glance on players' social media accounts tells you that.
